Since we have a large dataset of review texts, it's necessary for us to apply some NLP methods on the texts.

### Sentiment Analysis

We have done sentiment analysis on each review text and got the corresponding positive, negative, neutral and compound scores. We calculated the average score for each rating group (from 1 to 5) to see what is the difference in sentiment of reviews with different ratings.

As we can see, as the rating goes up, the positive sentiment score is increasing and the negative sentiment score is decreasing. Overall, the compound sentiment score is 

### Part of Speech Tagging

We've tagged every word in the review texts with its part of speech(POS). We would like to know if all the POS tags have the same occurrence rate in each rating group. We normalized the occurence of a POS tag in a rating group by the total count of words in that group, and then calculated the distribution of each POS tag. Suppose a POS tag is uniformly distributed in each group, its percentage in each group should be about 20%. We made the boxplot of occurrence rate for each POS tag and the results are as follows:

There are some POS tags with a high standanrd deviation. We
